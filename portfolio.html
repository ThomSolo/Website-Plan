                                Fellow Employer,<br>&nbsp;<br>The purpose to which I’m writing this inquiry is
                                due to any possible job listings in Computer Science and IT fields. I have a
                                strong belief that I qualify for any job listings (especially entry-level) or I
                                would not be writing this letter now. As I have mentioned in my resume, I’m
                                currently attending the college known as Kean University and would like for you
                                (the reader) to continue in this branch of trust.<br>&nbsp;<br>To begin with, my
                                current education at Kean University and my previous one at Union County College
                                have increased my prior strengths, knowledge, and performance in Computer
                                Coding, Hardware, and Software. I have practiced creating, developing, and
                                testing programs in Java, by obtaining a medium to intermediate level of coding
                                skills in Java. As I have acquired an Associate in Computer Science from Union
                                County College and am currently working on a Bachelor of Computer Science at
                                Kean University, my insight into the Java language hasn’t been fully heightened
                                but applies to services at your will.<br>&nbsp;<br>Furthermore, to expand on my
                                IT skills, while a student in high school, I worked on computer hardware,
                                software, etc. To continue explaining what I’m saying, I have Repaired numerous
                                errors and problems that occurred with my previous school’s technology whether
                                it was the hardware or fixing something with the software. As it doesn’t end
                                there, I have assisted multiple students, teachers, staff, etc. with their
                                technological needs. Even though I had to perform regular maintenance to the
                                technology, I still managed to have time for completing assignments, quizzes,
                                tests, and other types of educational work.<br>&nbsp;<br>As I mentioned before,
                                there is a resume attached to this letter with possibly more information on
                                skills, work history, etc. I would like to meet with you, my fellow employer, to
                                discuss an interview about possible job positions that fit the given
                                qualifications. Besides that, you can contact me at or via
                                email at <a href="mailto:thomsolo@kean.edu">thomsolo@kean.edu</a>. Thank you for
